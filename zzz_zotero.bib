	abstract = {Temperature and precipitation extremes and their potential future changes are evaluated in an ensemble of global coupled climate models participating in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) diagnostic exercise for the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Climate extremes are expressed in terms of 20-yr return values of annual extremes of near-surface temperature and 24-h precipitation amounts. The simulated changes in extremes are documented for years 2046–65 and 2081–2100 relative to 1981–2000 in experiments with the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) B1, A1B, and A2 emission scenarios. Overall, the climate models simulate present-day warm extremes reasonably well on the global scale, as compared to estimates from reanalyses. The model discrepancies in simulating cold extremes are generally larger than those for warm extremes, especially in sea ice–covered areas. Simulated present-day precipitation extremes are plausible in the extratropics, but uncertainties in extreme precipitation in the Tropics are very large, both in the models and the available observationally based datasets. Changes in warm extremes generally follow changes in the mean summertime temperature. Cold extremes warm faster than warm extremes by about 30\%–40\%, globally averaged. The excessive warming of cold extremes is generally confined to regions where snow and sea ice retreat with global warming. With the exception of northern polar latitudes, relative changes in the intensity of precipitation extremes generally exceed relative changes in annual mean precipitation, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Consistent with the increased intensity of precipitation extremes, waiting times for late-twentieth-century extreme precipitation events are reduced almost everywhere, with the exception of a few subtropical regions. The multimodel multiscenario consensus on the projected change in the globally averaged 20-yr return values of annual extremes of 24-h precipitation amounts is that there will be an increase of about 6\% with each kelvin of global warming, with the bulk of models simulating values in the range of 4\%–10\% K−1. The very large intermodel disagreements in the Tropics suggest that some physical processes associated with extreme precipitation are not well represented in models. This reduces confidence in the projected changes in extreme precipitation.},

The approach, called the likelihood-weighted method (LWM), involves Bayesian inference incorporating group likelihood for the generalised Pareto or generalised extreme value distributions and near-uniform prior distributions for parameters. Group likelihood (as opposed to standard likelihood) provides a straightforward mechanism to incorporate measurement error in inference, and adopting flat priors simplifies computation. The method's statistical and computational efficiency are validated by numerical experiment for small samples of size at most 10. Ocean wave applications reveal shortcomings of competitor methods, and advantages of estimating epistemic uncertainty within a Bayesian framework in particular. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

In this study, the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is fitted to monthly minima of European winter 6-hourly minimum temperatures from the ECHAM5/MPI-OM global climate model simulations and the ECMWF reanalysis product known as ERA-40, with an indicator for atmospheric blocking conditions being used as covariate. It is demonstrated that relating the location and scale parameter of the GEV distribution to atmospheric blocking improves the fit to extreme minimum temperatures in large areas of Europe. The climate model simulations agree reasonably with ERA-40 in the present climate (1961–2000). Under the influence of atmospheric blocking, a decrease in the 0.95th quantiles of extreme minimum temperatures can be distinguished. This cooling effect of atmospheric blocking is, however, diminished in future climate simulations because...},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02708},
	abstract = {The generalized extreme value distribution and its particular case, the Gumbel extreme value distribution, are widely applied for extreme value analysis. The Gumbel distribution has certain drawbacks because it is a non-heavy-tailed distribution and is characterized by constant skewness and kurtosis. The generalized extreme value distribution is frequently used in this context because it encompasses the three possible limiting distributions for a normalized maximum of infinite samples of independent and identically distributed observations. However, the generalized extreme value distribution might not be a suitable model when each observed maximum does not come from a large number of observations. Hence, other forms of generalizations of the Gumbel distribution might be preferable. Our goal is to collect in the present literature the distributions that contain the Gumbel distribution embedded in them and to identify those that have flexible skewness and kurtosis, are heavy-tailed and could be competitive with the generalized extreme value distribution. The generalizations of the Gumbel distribution are described and compared using an application to a wind speed data set and Monte Carlo simulations. We show that some distributions suffer from overparameterization and coincide with other generalized Gumbel distributions with a smaller number of parameters, i.e., are non-identifiable. Our study suggests that the generalized extreme value distribution and a mixture of two extreme value distributions should be considered in practical applications.},

	abstract = {We present a dataset of daily resolution climatic time series that has been compiled for the European Climate Assessment (ECA). As of December 2001, this ECA dataset comprises 199 series of minimum, maximum and/or daily mean temperature and 195 series of daily precipitation amount observed at meteorological stations in Europe and the Middle East. Almost all series cover the standard normal period 1961–90, and about 50\% extends back to at least 1925. Part of the dataset (90\%) is made available for climate research on CDROM and through the Internet (at http://www.knmi.nl/samenw/eca). A comparison of the ECA dataset with existing gridded datasets, having monthly resolution, shows that correlation coefficients between ECA stations and nearest land grid boxes between 1946 and 1999 are higher than 0.8 for 93\% of the temperature series and for 51\% of the precipitation series. The overall trends in the ECA dataset are of comparable magnitude to those in the gridded datasets. The potential of the ECA dataset for climate studies is demonstrated in two examples. In the first example, it is shown that the winter (October–March) warming in Europe in the 1976–99 period is accompanied by a positive trend in the number of warm-spell days at most stations, but not by a negative trend in the number of cold-spell days. Instead, the number of cold-spell days increases over Europe. In the second example, it is shown for winter precipitation between 1946 and 1999 that positive trends in the mean amount per wet day prevail in areas that are getting drier and wetter. Because of its daily resolution, the ECA dataset enables a variety of empirical climate studies, including detailed analyses of changes in the occurrence of extremes in relation to changes in mean temperature and total precipitation.

	abstract = {This chapter discusses the theory and applications of the mean residual life (MRL). MRL has been used as far back as the third century A.D. The MRL function is like the density function, the moment generating function, or the characteristic function: for a distribution with a finite mean, the MRL completely determines the distribution via an inversion formula. Not only is the MRL used for parametric modeling but also for nonparametric modeling. Large nonparametric classes of life distributions such as decreasing mean residual life (DMRL) and new better than used in expectation (NBUE) have been defined using MRL. Actuaries apply MRL to setting rates and benefits for life insurance. In the biomedical setting researchers analyze survivorship studies by MRL. IMRL distributions have been found useful as models in the social sciences for the lifelengths of wars and strikes. MRL functions occur naturally in other areas such as optimal disposal of an asset, renewal theory, dynamic programming, and branching processes. The chapter defines more formally the MRL function and surveys some of the key theory.},

The distance is measured in terms of the pertaining densities with the limit being ultimately attained if and only if FFF is ultimately a generalized Pareto distribution. Consequently, the rate of convergence of the extremes in an iid sample, whether in terms of the distribution of the largest order statistics or of corresponding empirical truncated point processes, is determined by the rate of convergence in the von Mises condition.

	abstract = {Extreme Value Modeling and Risk Analysis: Methods and Applications presents a broad overview of statistical modeling of extreme events along with the most recent methodologies and various applications. The book brings together background material and advanced topics, eliminating the need to sort through the massive amount of literature on the subject.  After reviewing univariate extreme value analysis and multivariate extremes, the book explains univariate extreme value mixture modeling, threshold selection in extreme value analysis, and threshold modeling of non-stationary extremes. It presents new results for block-maxima of vine copulas, develops time series of extremes with applications from climatology, describes max-autoregressive and moving maxima models for extremes, and discusses spatial extremes and max-stable processes. The book then covers simulation and conditional simulation of max-stable processes; inference methodologies, such as composite likelihood, Bayesian inference, and approximate Bayesian computation; and inferences about extreme quantiles and extreme dependence. It also explores novel applications of extreme value modeling, including financial investments, insurance and financial risk management, weather and climate disasters, clinical trials, and sports statistics.  Risk analyses related to extreme events require the combined expertise of statisticians and domain experts in climatology, hydrology, finance, insurance, sports, and other fields. This book connects statistical/mathematical research with critical decision and risk assessment/management applications to stimulate more collaboration between these statisticians and specialists.},

Parameter estimation in the nonstationary GEV model is generally done with the maximum likelihood estimation method (ML). In this work, we develop the generalized maximum likelihood estimation method (GML), in which covariates are incorporated into parameters. A simulation study is carried out to compare the performances of the GML and the ML methods in the case of the stationary GEV model (GEV0), the nonstationary case with a linear dependence of the location parameter on covariates (GEV1), the nonstationary case with a quadratic dependence on covariates (GEV2), and the nonstationary case with linear dependence in both location and scale parameters (GEV11). Simulation results show that the GLM method performs better than the ML method for all studied cases. The nonstationary GEV model is also applied to a case study to illustrate its potential. The case study deals with the annual maximum precipitation at the Randsburg station in California, and the covariate process is taken to be the Southern Index Oscillation.},

	abstract = {Estimation of the extremal behavior of a process is often based on the fitting of asymptotic extreme value models to relatively short series of data. Maximum likelihood has emerged as a flexible and powerful modeling tool in such applications, but its performance with small samples has been shown to be poor relative to an alternative fitting procedure based on probability weighted moments. We argue here that the small-sample superiority of the probability weighted moments estimator is due to the assumption of a restricted parameter space, corresponding to finite population moments. To incorporate similar information in a likelihood-based analysis, we propose a penalized maximum likelihood estimator that retains the modeling flexibility and large-sample optimality of the maximum likelihood estimator, but improves on its small-sample properties. The properties of the penalized likelihood estimator are verified in a simulation study, and in application to sea-level data, which also enables the procedure to be evaluated in the context of structural models for extremes.},

The simulation domain is the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) for East Asia, and the number of grid points is 197 × 233 with a 50-km horizontal resolution. Three new performance-based ensemble averaging (PEA) methods are developed in this study using 1) bias, root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) and absolute correlation (PEA\_BRC), RMSE and absolute correlation (PEA\_RAC), and RMSE and original correlation (PEA\_ROC). The other two ensemble methods are equal-weighted averaging (EWA) and multivariate linear regression (Mul\_Reg). To derive the weighting coefficients and cross validate the prediction skills of the five ensemble methods, the authors considered 15-yr and 5-yr data, respectively, from the 20-yr simulation data. Among the five ensemble methods, the Mul\_Reg (EWA) method shows the best (worst) skill during the training period. The PEA\_RAC and PEA\_ROC methods show skills that are similar to those of Mul\_Reg during the training period. However, the skills and stabilities of Mul\_Reg were drastically reduced when this method was applied to the prediction period. But, the skills and stabilities of PEA\_RAC were only slightly reduced in this case. As a result, PEA\_RAC shows the best skill, irrespective of the seasons and variables, during the prediction period. This result confirms that the new ensemble method developed in this study, PEA\_RAC, can be used for the prediction of regional climate.},

	abstract = {Designs conditions for marine structures are typically informed by threshold-based extreme value analyses of oceanographic variables, in which excesses of a high threshold are modelled by a generalized Pareto (GP) distribution. Too low a threshold leads to bias from model mis-specification; raising the threshold increases the variance of estimators: a bias-variance trade-off. Many existing threshold selection methods do not address this trade-off directly, but rather aim to select the lowest threshold above which the GP model is judged to hold approximately. In this paper Bayesian cross-validation is used to address the trade-off by comparing thresholds based on predictive ability at extreme levels. Extremal inferences can be sensitive to the choice of a single threshold. We use Bayesian model-averaging to combine inferences from many thresholds, thereby reducing sensitivity to the choice of a single threshold. The methodology is applied to significant wave height datasets from the northern North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.},

	abstract = {In this study the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution function was used to assess nonstationarity in annual maximum wave heights for selected locations in the Greek Seas, both in the present and future climates. The available significant wave height data were divided into groups corresponding to the present period (1951–2000), a first future period (2001–2050), and a second future period (2051–2100). For each time period, the parameters of the GEV distribution were specified as functions of time-varying covariates and estimated using the conditional density network (CDN). For each location and selected time period, a total number of 29 linear and nonlinear models were fitted to the wave data, for a given combination of covariates. The covariates used in the GEV-CDN models consisted of wind fields resulting from the Regional Climate Model version 3 (RegCM3) developed by the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) with a spatial resolution of 10 km × 10 km, after being processed using principal component analysis (PCA). The results obtained from the best fitted models in the present and future periods for each location were compared, revealing different patterns of relationships between wind components and extreme wave height quantiles in different parts of the Greek Seas and different periods. The analysis demonstrates an increase of extreme wave heights in the first future period as compared with the present period, causing a significant threat to Greek coastal areas in the North Aegean Sea and the Ionian Sea.},

Previous studies show that small-sample maximum-likelihood estimators (MLE) of parameters are unstable and recommend L moment estimators. More recent research shows that method of moments quantile estimators have for −0.25 {\textless} κ {\textless} 0.30 smaller root-mean-square error than L moments and MLEs. Examination of the behavior of MLEs in small samples demonstrates that absurd values of the GEV-shape parameter κ can be generated. Use of a Bayesian prior distribution to restrict κ values to a statistically/physically reasonable range in a generalized maximum likelihood (GML) analysis eliminates this problem. In our examples the GML estimator did substantially better than moment and L moment quantile estimators for − 0.4 ≤ κ ≤ 0.},

We prove existence of the posterior distributions and posterior moments under a general class of priors. Using a variety of priors in this class we conduct numerical simulations of posteriors. We find that in most examples Bayesian estimators with a shrinkage prior on the VAR coefficients and the reference prior of Yang and Berger (Ann. Statist. 22 (1994) 1195) on the VAR covariance matrix dominate MLE, Bayesian estimators with the diffuse prior, and Bayesian estimators with the prior used in RATS. We also examine the informative Minnesota prior and find that its performance depends on the nature of the data sample and on the tightness of the Minnesota prior. A tightly set Minnesota prior is better when the data generating processes are similar to random walks, but the shrinkage prior or constant prior can be better otherwise.},

The method of LH moments is formulated for the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution along with two detailed examples. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to illustrate the performance of using the method of LH moments to fit the GEV distribution to both GEV and non-GEV samples.

Parameter stability plots, whereby one plots maximum likelihood estimates of supposedly threshold-independent parameters against threshold, form one of the main tools for threshold selection by practitioners, principally due to their simplicity. However, one repeated criticism of these plots is their lack of interpretability, with pointwise confidence intervals being strongly dependent across the range of thresholds. In this article, we exploit the independent-increments structure of maximum likelihood estimators to produce complementary plots with greater interpretability, and suggest a simple likelihood-based procedure that allows for automated threshold selection.

The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimension of a sequence of target densities, n, converges to ∞∞{\textbackslash}infty. When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled according to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain converges to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straightforward efficiency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form. Extensions of the result are discussed.},

Since 2001, there have been nearly 200 papers using MCMC in publications of the Ecological Society of America and the British Ecological Society, including more than 75 in the journal Ecology and 35 in the Journal of Applied Ecology. 2. We have noted that many authors routinely ‘thin’ their simulations, discarding all but every kth sampled value; of the studies we surveyed with details on MCMC implementation, 40\% reported thinning. 3. Thinning is often unnecessary and always inefficient, reducing the precision with which features of the Markov chain are summarised. The inefficiency of thinning MCMC output has been known since the early 1990’s, long before MCMC appeared in ecological publications. 4. We discuss the background and prevalence of thinning, illustrate its consequences, discuss circumstances when it might be regarded as a reasonable option and recommend against routine thinning of chains unless necessitated by computer memory limitations.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

Any application area that benefits from regression analysis can also benefit from semiparametric regression. Assuming only a basic familiarity with ordinary parametric regression, this user-friendly book explains the techniques and benefits of semiparametric regression in a concise and modular fashion. The authors make liberal use of graphics and examples plus case studies taken from environmental, financial, and other applications. They include practical advice on implementation and pointers to relevant software. The 2003 book is suitable as a textbook for students with little background in regression as well as a reference book for statistically oriented scientists such as biostatisticians, econometricians, quantitative social scientists, epidemiologists, with a good working knowledge of regression and the desire to begin using more flexible semiparametric models. Even experts on semiparametric regression should find something new here.},
