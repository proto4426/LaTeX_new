\section{Presentation of the Analysis : Temperatures from Uccle}\label{sec:presuccle}

Data used during this thesis come from the "Institut Royal de Météorologie" (IRM) located in Uccle. We were provided official data used by meteorologists in Belgium. We wanted to have data that are reliable enough in order to be able to produce relevant results. 

We were provided a set of databases from the IRM. We decided to focus on temperature analysis in order to assess climate warming. Rainfall data analysis would have also been interesting in EVT. 

The fact that the dataset starts only at year $1901$ is for reasons of homogeneity since the evolution of the shelters that occurred since previous period. Technology that were used to measure temperatures also lead to several types of measurements errors.

For meteorological considerations and again for reasons of homogeneity, it is better to analyze the temperatures in \emph{closed shelters}, following for example \citet{lindsey_use_1956}. Indeed, thanks to grateful advices given by C.Tricot, climatologist at the IRM, temperatures in closed shelters have the advantage of not being too influenced by the solar radiation which artificially increase temperatures, especially in periods of \emph{extreme} heats and thus high solar activity. This is actually what we want to study. 
For example, the maximum temperature of $36.6^{\circ}c$ that occurred the 27th June 1947 in closed shelters was actually measured at $38.8^{\circ}c$ in open shelters the same day. 



\subsection*{Comparisons with freely available data} 

A similar dataset for Uccle is publicly available on the Internet\footnote{\url{http://lstat.kuleuven.be/Wiley/Data/ecad00045TX.txt}}. It was a project initially performed by the KMNI and which was used by \citet{beirlant_statistics_2006}. However, we did not want to simply analyze these data as we did not know if we could really trust them, for reasons mentioned above.

Afterwards, we compared these two datasets for years $1901$ to $2001$. We remark effectively that there are large differences
in these two datasets. For example,
$54\%$ of measurements are equal with those of the dataset in open shelters against $14.4\%$ in the closed shelters. For this reason, we have confidence that the public dataset have temperatures measured in open shelters which is not recommended. Hence, we conclude that large errors of measures can easily occur in unofficial data which confirms the fact that it is important to get reliable data if one wants to provide reliable analysis. 



\section{First Analysis : Annual Maxima}\label{sec:firstana}


\subsection{Descriptive Analysis}

There are plenty of very interesting descriptive analysis we could make, but most of them are not very useful. The idea here is just to have a global overview of the data. Code provide most of the descriptive analysis. To summarize most of the information, we plotted a violin-plot and a density plot of the \textbf{daily} maximum temperatures in Figure \ref{fig:violin_density} in \hyperref[app:fig]{Appendix \textbf{\ref{app:fig}}} where we divided data in each meteorological seasons to emphasize this difference. We see for example that the the spread is higher for autumn and spring.

Now, we will rather stick on the block-maxima approach by taking yearly blocks leaving us with $n=116$ data which seem justifiable for further GEV analysis and the conditions to hold. We will discuss the choice of the block length further in the \hyperref[sec:anagev]{next Chapter}.

\subsection{First visualization with simple models}\label{sec:firstvisu}

We present the series of yearly maxima in Figure \ref{first_fig} where we introduce 3 \textbf{models for the trend} :


\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{gg12.pdf}\caption{Yearly maxima together with three first models that represent the trend. Note that shaded grey area around the linear trend represent its $95\%$ pointwise confidence interval on the fitted values. }%i.e. there is $95\%$ confidence that the "true" (population) regression line lies within the shaded region.}
\label{first_fig}
\end{figure}


\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Linear regression} is a \textbf{parametric} fit. We remark that it is slightly but significantly increasing over time ($\text{p-value}\approx 10^{-5}$). From this model, one rough interpretation we can have is that each year we expect the annual maximum temperature to increase by $\hat{b}=0.025^{\circ}c$ ($\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{b}}=0.005)$.

\item \emph{Local Polynomial regression } or LOESS is a \textbf{nonparametric} fit. It tells us that the yearly maxima process is rather "smooth". The drop in the series visible around years $1950$ to $1975$ is probably due to noise rather than a real decrease or freezing of the maximum temperatures at this time. Moreover, it disappears if we change the parameter controlling the degree of smoothing. We will assess that more formally in the \hyperref[sec:splines]{next Section} with another nonparametric model.

\item \emph{Broken-linear regression} is a \textbf{parametric} fit. We wanted to emphasize visually the difference in trend between the period [1901-1975] and [1976-2016]. These two periods have been chosen arbitrarily and we remark that period [1901-1952] has also a very high positive slope. We will study that in more details in \hyperref[sec:splines]{next Section}.
\end{itemize}
These different models give us insights on the process we will study throughout the rest of this thesis. We will not develop further the results of each model as this is not the subject of this thesis and we are more interested to assess this trend and its statistical significance overt time with a more interesting method.


\subsection{Deeper Trend Analysis : Splines derivatives in GAM}\label{sec:splines}

Apart from the significant pointwise increasing linear trend, we did not find concrete results. Moreover, we see in the series in Figure \ref{first_fig} in that a linear trend to the entire series could be seen as too restrictive. Regarding the broken-linear trend for example, we would like to assess if there is indeed a difference in the slope of the trend over some time periods. 

We assume the reader knows about \emph{ Generalized Additive Models} (GAM) developed by \citet{hastie_generalized_1986}. We also assume the reader knows about \emph{penalized splines} and \emph{splines smoothing}. Theoretical explanations of these concepts can be found in \citet[chapter 3, 6 and 11]{ruppert_semiparametric_2003} which will be the reference book of this section. Replacing covariates with smooth functions such as smoothing splines will result in a more flexible nonparametric model. We will also follow the simulation-based Bayesian approach of \citet{marra_coverage_2012} that compare coverage properties of intervals.


\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Pointwise vs Simultaneous intervals}
\subsubsection*{Pointwise or Simultaneous confidence intervals ?}

For this analysis, we thought important to differentiate between the two types of intervals in order to better understand what is truly meant by "confidence interval". A special example is the grey area around the linear fit in Figure \ref{first_fig} which represent a $95\%$ interval for the regression line (and not for the data), taking into account variability in the data. If we make repeated sampling over and over and take the predicted values, then the new linear fit will be in the grey zone approximately $95\%$ of the time.

Let $\mathcal{X}$ denote the set of $x$ values of interest, i.e. $\mathcal{X}=[1901,2016]$ in our case and $f(\cdot)$ is the model of interest, e.g. the linear regression, or the GAM model that we will fit. Hence, we define 
\begin{itemize}
	\item A \textbf{pointwise} $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval $\Big\{\big[L(x),U(x)\big] \ : \ x\in \mathcal{X}\Big\}$ approximately satisfies
	\begin{equation}
	\text{Pr}\Big\{L(x)\leq f(x)\leq U(x)\Big\}\geq 1-\alpha, \qquad \forall x\in\mathcal{X}.
	\end{equation}
	
	\item A \textbf{Simultaneous} $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval must satisfy 
	\begin{equation}
	\text{Pr}\Big\{L(x)\leq f(x)\leq U(x), \ \forall x\in\mathcal{X}\Big\}\geq 1-\alpha.
	\end{equation}
\end{itemize} 
From the pointwise confidence intervals we can say that (example) $f(1980)$ has $95\%$ chance to lie within (-1,0) (say) and $f(2000)$ has also $95\%$ to lie within (0.2,1.2) BUT it is a fallacy to say simultaneously that both are contained in these intervals at the same time with $95\%$ confidence.% \citet[section 6.5]{ruppert_semiparametric_2003}

For the interested reader, theoretical details on how to mathematically derive simultaneous intervals are available in \citet[pp.142-144]{ruppert_semiparametric_2003}.


\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Methodology}
\subsubsection*{Methodology}

\begin{itemize}
\item We fitted a simple GAM model on the annual maxima relying on the \texttt{mgcv} package from \citet{maindonald_data_2006}.

\item  Figure \ref{fig:acfresgam1} let in \hyperref[app:fig]{Appendix \textbf{\ref{app:fig}}} shows the correlation structure of the serial normalized residuals. As selection of a model for the residuals is not trivial from this figure, we fitted several time series models for the residuals. It is not necessary to consider too complex models so we stopped at 2 additional degrees of freedom. Results are let in Table \ref{table:gamresid} in \hyperref[app:fig]{Appendix \textbf{\ref{app:fig}}} where we see that BIC will prefer the independent model for the residuals but the AIC will not. Parsimony being important, we chose the independent model to draw plots with simultaneous intervals but we will also keep MA(1) for comparisons. Likelihood ratio tests confirmed our choice. Diagnostics of the model presented in Figure \ref{fig:diagnogam} in \hyperref[app:fig]{Appendix \textbf{\ref{app:fig}}} are fine.

\item As we took a Gaussian (identity) link, our model can hence be written as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:gam}
Y_{\text{GAM}}(\text{year}) = \alpha + f_{\text{(k)}}(\text{year})+\epsilon , \qquad\quad \epsilon\sim\text{WN}.
\end{equation}
where $f$ is modelled by smoothing splines, $\epsilon$ can be MA(1) and $Y$ represent annual TX. We set the dimension of the basis $k$ for the spline to $20$ to ensure a reasonable degree of smoothness as there is modest amount of non-linearity in the series and we did not perform cross-validation as it will not influence the results that much. 

\item  To account for uncertainty, we simulated $M = 10^4$ draws (quite fast) from the posterior of the GAM model in (\ref{eq:gam}). Hence, the confidence intervals (or bands) that we compute will be of the form of Bayesian credible intervals,  discussed in \hyperref[bayes_cred_int]{Section \textbf{\ref{bayes_cred_int}}} and which is highlighted by \citet{marra_coverage_2012}.
$50$ posterior draws are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:post_draws} %let in \hyperref[app:fig]{appendix \ref{app:fig}}
 displaying pointwise (in yellow) and simultaneous (in red) intervals. We point out that pointwise intervals are too narrow.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering	\includegraphics[width=.75\linewidth]{post_draws.pdf}\caption{displays draws from the posterior distribution of the model. Notice the large uncertainty associated to the posterior draws (grey lines).  The coverages are calculated for $M=10^4$ simulations. }\label{fig:post_draws}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Coverage Analysis} 

We would like to highlight the inadequacy of the pointwise intervals. Hence, we computed posterior draws of the fitted GAM and we counted how many draws lied within each intervals.

\begin{table}[!htbp] \centering 
  \caption{Proportion of the $M$ posterior simulations which are covered by the confidence intervals} \label{tab:cov} 
\begin{tabular}{@{\extracolsep{5pt}}lccccc} 
\toprule
\vspace{-.1cm}\\[-1.8ex] 
\textbf{Coverage at $95\%$} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$M=20$} &  \multicolumn{1}{c}{$M=100$} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$M=10^3$} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$M=10^5$} \vspace{.1cm} \\ 
\midrule
\underline{Pointwise} & $40\%$ & $63\%$ & $61.1\%$ & $59.463\%$ \\
\underline{Simultaneous} & $80\%$ & $91\%$ & $94.9\%$ & $95.019\%$  \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular} 
\end{table}
We clearly see that the coverages indeed converge to the true value $95\%$ of the confidence level for the simultaneous intervals when $M$ becomes very large, while it converges rather to $\approx 60\%$ for the pointwise intervals.

Shiny application has been build from this graph to better visualize the impact of the number of simulations on the confidence intervals and how their coverage vary, both visually and quantitatively.

Note that the results are similar if we do the experiment on the first derivatives $f^{'}(\cdot)$ of the splines rather than on the splines itself.


\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Final Results}
\subsubsection*{Final Results}

First, we can see the two significant increases in trend from Figure \ref{fig:center_gam} let in \hyperref[app:fig]{Appendix \textbf{\ref{app:fig}}} when we do not correct for simultaneous intervals. The decrease we have pointed out in the preceding section between 1945 and 1970 with LOESS is hence not significant here and is hence due to randomness.


Some remarks from the two plots in Figure \ref{fig:derivsplines}, considering now splines derivatives :

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\includegraphics[width=.99\linewidth]{splines.pdf}\caption{Plots of the first derivative $f_{(20)}^{'}(\text{year})$ of the estimated splines on the retained GAM model. Grey area represents $95\%$ confidence bands. Sections of the spline where the confidence interval does not include zero are indicated by thicker lines. }\label{fig:derivsplines}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item Together with the series in Figure \ref{first_fig}, we can make the link between the trend behavior of the series and the splines first derivative which accurately models the slope behavior of the trend. 
\item We notice the increasing trend with decreasing slope, i.e. $ f_{(20)}^{''}(\text{year})<0$, until year $\approx 1945$ where it becomes negative. Then the slope increase and the trend starts to re-increase around 1962. This upward trend that the series of annual maxima is facing for this last period brings light to the climate warming we are all talking about. However, we see that we are now at a "critical point" for several years, i.e. $f_{(20)}^{''}(\text{year})\approx 0$, bringing light to the likely linear trend. 

\item  Whereas the pointwise confidence interval include significant regions (i.e. 0 is not included in the interval), the simultaneous interval which is accounting for the increase in uncertainty, have no significant regions. Then, we cannot conclude that there has been any significant increasing in the annual maximum temperatures in any periods.

\end{itemize}


\section{Comments and Structure of the Analysis }

 We have found that there is indeed an upward (linear) trend for the series of yearly maxima but this is not significant when doing the correction for simultaneous intervals.
Hence, a nonstationary analysis is worth to be continued.
After having made this introductory analysis, we will go through with the specific subject of this thesis, the extreme value analysis. Hence, next chapter will present first a stationary GEV analysis and then allow nonstationarity in various ways.


\paragraph*{POT} 
As you have seen, the analysis in POT or in GEV involves different methods and different  subsets of data. In this text, we will not display the results of the POT analysis to keep the text not too enormous. Henceforth, we will be able to focus on the GEV analysis only. But \textbf{note that} the analysis in POT have been done is are available on the same \href{https://github.com/proto4426/PissoortThesis}{repository} presented above.
\hyperref[appgit]{Appendix\textbf{ \ref{appgit}}} summarize its contents.


Moreover, we have also conducted some analysis by dividing the dataset by seasons, by hot or cold months (July-August or January-February), ... We also analyzed annual minimum temperatures and we found a trend that is less pronounced for minimum temperatures.
Comparisons are interesting, also available on the \href{https://github.com/proto4426/PissoortThesis}{repository}, but we will only focus on a GEV analysis on yearly maxima.
