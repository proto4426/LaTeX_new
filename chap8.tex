\section{Model Comparisons}

\subsection{Statistical Tools}

In order to compare our models, that is for example to check whether a trend (or seasonality) is statistically significant, or if the nonstationnary models provide an improvement over the simpler (stationary) model, we will make use of the \textbf{deviance statistic} defined as 
\begin{equation}
D = 2\big\{\ell_1(\mathcal{M}_1)-\ell_0(\mathcal{M}_0)\big\},
\end{equation}

for two nested models $\mathcal{M}_0\subset \mathcal{M}_1$, where $\ell_1(\mathcal{M}_1)$ and $\ell_0(\mathcal{M}_0)$ are the maximized log-likelihoods under models $\mathcal{M}_1$ and $\mathcal{M}_0$ respectively as defined in .

Asymptotically, the distribution of $D$ is $\chi_k$ with $k$ (df) representing the difference of parameters between model $\mathcal{M}_1$ and $\mathcal{M}_0$. Thus, comparisons of $D$ with the critical values from $\chi_k$ will guide our decision.
